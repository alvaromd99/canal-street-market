			'Joe’s Steam Rice Roll started with Chef and Owner Joe Rong’s longing for a steamed rice roll—the way he had it growing up in China: fresh rice batter poured onto a tray, along with fresh meat and vegetables, and all cooked within a steamer. Serendipitously, Joe’s quest for the ideal steamed rice roll led him back home to Taishan, China, where he learned from masters of the craft as a humble student. What we do differently is how we make our rice batter: fresh rice grinded daily by a stone mill, and combined with our in-house secret mix to produce a one-of-a-kind soft and chewy texture. Our mission is to continuously improve and innovate to share our best version of an authentic taste of our culture with the World.',

			'Since 2017, Kabisera has undergone a constant stream of reiterations and the ever-changing menu and frequent pop-up collaborations with other Filipino chefs and artists reflect that. Kabisera’s current mood is in offering a turo-turo style menu on top of their usual paninis, rice bowls, and salads, and utilizing their space to showcase specialty food products and artwork from local Filipino artists and entrepreneurs. Their pastries and kakanins, however, are what first put them on the map—like the biko, a sweet cake that uses glutinous rice and is topped with latik, a syrup made of coconut cream that will have you reassess your relationship with caramel.',
